# Thai Grading Portal
## Overview
Thai Grading Portal is a tool to easily view, edit, store and otherwise manage grade records in the Thai public school system. This is the public version, and so all PII has been removed from the version that's actively being worked on. I'm studying javascript now in order to implement the remaining features more smoothly (dynamic grade editing and data visualizations in student, class and teacher profiles)

## Completed Features:
- User accounts with secure login service
- Ability to change username or password
- Selectable classes in a menu on the class selection page which, when selected, bring the user to the grade viewing page for that class
- Selectable subjects in a menu on the class selection page which, when selected, bring you to a filtered class selection page
- Viewing page for grades, specific to class section and subject
